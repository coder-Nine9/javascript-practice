# 🔢 Advanced Number Manipulation

A JavaScript mini application that performs **conditional logic operations** on two numbers based on their signs.

## 📌 Description
The user enters two numbers **A** and **B**.  
When clicking the button, the program checks their signs and applies one of two operations:

- **If A and B have the same sign (or one is zero):**
  - Their values are swapped
- **If A and B have different signs:**
  - A becomes the sum of A and B
  - B becomes the product of the original values

The new values are then displayed on the screen.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

## 📂 Project Files
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters values for A and B :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
2. JavaScript checks the condition `A × B ≥ 0` :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
3. Based on the result, values are swapped or recalculated
4. Updated values are displayed dynamically

## ▶️ How to Run
Open `index.html` in your browser.  
No installation required.
